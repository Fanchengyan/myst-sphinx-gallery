.. _number_prefix:

============================================
Using ``alt`` attribute (with number prefix)
============================================

This section tests:


- Testing the functionality with the ``alt`` strategy using the ``gallery_thumbnail`` as the ``alt`` attribute for different file types: ``.rst``, ``.ipynb``, and ``.md``.
- Verifying the examples order when the example files **have a number prefix in their name**.

.. note::

    The examples are ordered by their file name, **with a number prefix**. The order of the examples in this page should be different from the order :ref:`no_number_prefix`.


The order of the examples in this page is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    .
    ├── 01-rst_order.rst
    ├── 02-nb_order.ipynb
    ├── 03-md_order.md
    └── GALLERY_HEADER.rst
