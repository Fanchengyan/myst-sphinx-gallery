.. _no_number_prefix:

===============================================
Using ``alt`` attribute (without number prefix)
===============================================

This section tests:

- Testing the functionality with the ``alt`` strategy: using the ``gallery_thumbnail`` as the ``alt`` attribute for different file types (``.rst``, ``.ipynb``, and ``.md``).
- Verifying the examples order when the example files **not have a number prefix in their name**.


.. note::

    The examples are ordered by their file name, **without a number prefix**. The order of the examples in this page should be different from the order :ref:`number_prefix`.

The order of the examples in this page is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    .
    ├── GALLERY_HEADER.rst
    ├── md.md
    ├── nb.ipynb
    └── rst.rst
