.. _cross_reference:

===========================
Cross-reference to Examples 
===========================

Example files
-------------

Each example file  will be automatically added a target for cross-referencing. The target is generated by adding the prefix ``example_`` to the file name and remove the file suffix.


For example, the file ``examples/basic/basic-example1.ipynb`` will be added a target named ``example_basic-example1`` in the first line/(markdown cell) of the file. You can refer to this target in the documentation using the following syntax:

in a ReStructuredText file (``*.rst``)

.. code-block:: rst

    :ref:`example_basic-example1`

in a ReStructuredText file (``*.rst``)

.. code-block:: markdown

    [Basic Example1](#example_basic-example1)

``GALLERY_HEADER.rst`` files
----------------------------

**You need to manually add a target in the first line** of the ``GALLERY_HEADER.rst`` file to enable cross-referencing. 

For example, the file ``GALLERY_HEADER.rst`` contains the following content:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. _example_basic_usages:

    ============
    Basic Usages
    ============

    This section contains basic usages of the library. ...


Then you can refer to this target in the documentation using the following syntax:

in a ReStructuredText file (``*.rst``)

.. code-block:: rst

    :ref:`example_basic_usages`

in a Markdown/Notebook file (``*.md,`` ``*.ipynb``) with MyST syntax

.. code-block:: markdown 

    [Basic Usages](#example_basic_usages)
