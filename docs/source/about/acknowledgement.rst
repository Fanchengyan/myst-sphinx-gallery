Acknowledgement
===============

- This package is heavily inspired by the
  `Sphinx-Gallery <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`_
  package, which is a great tool for creating gallery written in Python.
- The gallery cards and layout is generated by the
  `Sphinx-Design <https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
  and the styles are referenced from the ``Sphinx-Gallery``.
- The images in the Demo Gallery are all from the
  `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html>`_
  and
  `EOMaps <https://eomaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
