==================================
Whatâ€™s new in 0.2.2 (Aug 19, 2024)
==================================

Enhancements
------------

Thumbnails
^^^^^^^^^^


- :class:`~myst_sphinx_gallery.ThumbnailConfig` now supports a new option:
  ``max_animation_frames``, to control the maximum number of frames for the
  animated thumbnail. This option is useful when the animation has too many
  frames, saving storage space and building time.
- ``quality_animated`` changed from ``15`` to ``50`` to improve the quality of
  the animation thumbnail. This change will not increase the animated
  thumbnail file size since frames are reduced by the
  ``max_animation_frames`` option.


Cross-referencing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- the target of ``GALLERY_HEADER.rst`` now will be added a suffix ``_header``
  to avoid conflict with the example files.

Runtime
^^^^^^^

Now, the runtime of building the gallery will be displayed in the console
output. This feature is useful when you want to know how long it takes to
build the gallery and optimize the building time by changing the configuration
options of thumbnails.
